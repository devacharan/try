# Probability Distributed Model (PDM) ‚Äì MATLAB Implementation

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the **Probability Distributed Moisture (PDM) model**, a lumped conceptual hydrological model. The model is based on the probability distribution of storage capacity for soil moisture accounting, linked to a routing component consisting of two parallel linear reservoirs.  

The implementation follows the concepts described in:  
- Moore, R. J. (1985), *The probability-distributed principle and runoff production at point and basin scales*, Hydrological Sciences Journal.  
- Moore, R. J. (2007), *The PDM rainfall‚Äìrunoff model*, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences.
